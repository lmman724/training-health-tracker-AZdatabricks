## Overview

About data:

The dataset for this use case contains **heartbeat data collected from health devices of 5 individuals** per hour over a period of 5 months - January 2020 to May 2020. Be mindful about the fact that 2020 was a leap year.

For each month there are two types of files:

1. File ending with month number. E.g.: health_tracker_data_2020_1.json
2. file ending with _late. This file contains records that arrived late. For instance some records for January month arrived in February. So these records will be present in 1_late.json and not in 2.json. This file may or may not be present for each month. E.g.: health_tracker_data_2020_1_late.json

File name format:

1. health_tracker_data_2020_<month>.json
2. health_trracker_data_2020_<month>_late.json

Here month value is:

1. 1 for January
2. 2 for February
3. 3 for March
4. 4 for April
5. 5 for May
